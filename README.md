# clox

This is the C implementation of lox in http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/
book.

This repository most definitely contains code not found in the original book,
checking out the original repo is recommended if you've landed here not
knowing what this is.

## How to build

You can use `clang` or `gcc` for compiling the main file. In the root of this
repo, execute:

```bash
clang main.c -o target\clox.exe
```
